The Friend Who Stayed Up With Me
It all began with a reel.
She was lying on her bed, phone in one hand, a half-eaten sandwich in the other. A coffee mug sat quietly on the table beside her, its warmth fading. After two hours of nonstop studying, her mind craved a break — something light, something mindless.
And then it appeared — a reel that read: “Drop your birthday and find someone born on the same day.” Playful. Random. Oddly inviting.
She smiled, curious to see if someone out there shared her birthday. She tapped into the comments. Someone had asked, “Anyone from January?” Replies poured in — 2nd Jan, 13th Jan, 21st Jan — names and dates scattered like stars.
And then, her eyes paused. Her heart skipped. There it was. The one she hadn’t known she was searching for. “Mine: 12th Jan.
She instantly dropped a reply to his comment: “Mine too.” He responded with a simple, warm word: “Nice.” Curious, she asked, “Which year?” He answered, “2004. Yours?” She smiled and typed back, “2005.”
That brief conversation, tucked away in the comment section of a reel, was the spark that lit the beginning of something rare and unforgettable.
For two days, they chatted under that reel, exchanging bits of curiosity and warmth. On Sunday evening, he sat staring at the screen, rereading their little chitchat in the comment section. With a sip of coffee, he thought for a moment, then typed on his phone: “Would you like to talk in inbox?”
At that same time, she was surrounded by her books, trying to solve some questions. Reaching for her phone to search for an answer, she noticed a new notification lighting up her screen—it was his comment again. A smile spread across her face as she read it. Without hesitation, she replied with a simple word that carried so much promise: “Yes.”
And then, out of curiosity, she messaged him in inbox: “Heyya.” He hadn’t been expecting an instant message from her, but when he saw it, a sparkle lit up his eyes and a bright smile spread across his lips. He instantly replied with a simple “Hi”—a warm greeting between two strangers. Yet, somehow, it didn’t feel like a stranger’s exchange at all.
They introduced themselves, sharing their names. The moment they discovered each other’s names, a quiet happiness filled them both. It felt special to know someone who shared the same birthday, as if fate had stitched a small thread between their lives. And just like that, the conversation began—simple, genuine, and full of promise.

🌆 Two Cities, One Connection
He lived in Maharashtra, in a joint family full of cousins, aunts, and uncles, so the house was always buzzing with noise, responsibilities, and interruptions. His parents were away for work. He was a quiet, introverted boy—minding his own business, never intruding on others, and not expecting much from anyone.
He had no close friends, just himself, living his life within the rhythm of his joint family. He had two younger siblings, both still in school, also away from their parents. But in a joint family, it never truly felt like their parents were absent; there was always someone around, and that made it easier. The house was big, filled with people, yet it offered no privacy.
He could never say no to anyone. That was simply who he was—gentle, innocent, and simple.
She, on the other hand, was in Delhi, having moved there recently for her graduation. It wasn’t her birthplace, but it had become her present. She was never the stayer; because of her parents’ jobs, she had grown up moving from one place to another.
Now, she was living in Delhi for further studies, not with her parents but with her siblings. Her brother worked in Delhi, and her sister had a job there too. Both were busy building their careers, while she, the third child of the family, the second youngest, often felt lonely.
Her days were filled with quiet moments—short calls with her parents once a day, catching up with old friends once a week, and long stretches of silence in between. Being the younger one, she often felt left behind, watching her siblings chase their ambitions while she was still trying to find her own path. Life in Delhi was uncertain, sometimes heavy, sometimes hopeful, but it was hers to live—and hers to shape.
He was pursuing his graduation, already in his third year of engineering. Nothing new seemed to happen in his life—the track was straight, predictable, and unchanged.
Between college and home, his days felt repetitive, yet deep inside he was craving something that could complete him, something that could fill the emptiness he carried quietly.
She, on the other hand, was just beginning college—the start of a new chapter, full of hopes and dreams. Her life felt fresh, uncertain, and wide open. Their worlds were completely different, with not a single thing in common. 
Their cities were far apart, their religions not the same, and their lifestyles shaped by different rhythms. By all measures, they were total opposites.
But none of that mattered. Friendship does not see colour, gender, or boundaries. It does not measure qualities or differences that divide people. True friendship is a feeling—pure, strong, and beyond explanation. And when they found each other, they clicked. Instantly. Effortlessly.
No one ever imagined they would end up as friends, but fate had its own quiet plan. What started as a small, ordinary exchange slowly blossomed into something rare and beautiful. Before they knew it, they had become each other’s closest companion—the kind of friend who shows up in every corner of life, bringing support, comfort, and laughter exactly when it’s needed most.

🌙 The Rhythm of Friendship
They began talking every day and every night—after coming back from college, after going somewhere, even after eating a meal. Their conversations became a rhythm, a routine, a comfort they both eagerly looked forward to.
They shared everything: the lectures, the way their day had unfolded, the exhaustion and chaos, the boredom, and even the quiet moments of loneliness. On some days, neither of them felt like socializing at all, so they simply skipped college. Like many others, they would stay in bed, tucked away from the world, and just talk to each other. And for them, that was enough.
She was the one who always stayed up at night. Insomnia made the hours feel endless, stretching into silence that often felt unbearable. But he became her night companion, the presence she could count on when the world was asleep.
Whenever she messaged at midnight, he replied within minutes—not out of obligation, but because he wanted to... Because he cared...
He was her quiet anchor, steady and reassuring. And she, in turn, was his listener, his encourager, his safe space. Whenever loneliness crept into his heart, she was there to remind him that someone had his back, that he wasn’t alone.
Just a few messages exchanged between them became something they craved, something that slowly wove itself into their lives. Neither of them had imagined that someone out there in the world could be this present, this constant—but they had found that in each other.
It was necessary, too, because if you want someone to care for you, you must first become that person for them. And that’s what they did. Without ever meeting face to face, without expecting anything in return, they became each other’s gap-fillers—the ones who quietly mended the empty spaces in each other’s hearts.
They talked about their families, opening little windows into the worlds they lived in—the challenges they faced, the kind of lives they carried quietly.
He told her about his younger siblings who went to school every day, about the cousins who teased him for no reason, and about the chaos of living in a joint family where privacy was rare and noise was constant.
She listened—truly listened. And because she did, he opened up in ways he never had with anyone else. For the first time, he found someone who could tolerate his long lectures, the thoughts he usually kept locked inside.
He didn’t share them with anyone else, but with her, he did. And she simply listened, with patience and care, making him feel heard in a way he had always longed for.
She started sharing her own world with him—the quiet apartment in Delhi she lived in with her siblings, the long evenings when her brother and sister were busy with work, and the loneliness that sometimes crept in when she was left to herself. 
She told him about her parents, about the constant moving from one city to another, and how she had never really felt rooted anywhere.
Together, they built a space where both of them could be vulnerable, where emptiness was replaced with companionship. Without realizing it, they had become each other’s shelter.

🕌 A Bond Beyond Boundaries
He was an introvert. Making friends had never been easy for him. Most of his school friends had drifted away, and the few who remained were the kind who only sent a birthday text—occasional, distant, almost forgotten. But with her, everything was different. He talked. He laughed. He shared.
Slowly, without even realizing it, he became the person he truly was—the version of himself no one else had ever met. And the first person to meet that hidden self was her. She was the girl who drew him out of his shell, the one who made him see himself in different colours, brighter and more alive than he had ever imagined.
They came from different religions, yet their friendship remained untouched by boundaries. He was Hindu, and she was Muslim. Never once did they insult each other’s faith or let old disputes that existed in the world come between them.
Sometimes, she would use words from her culture that he didn’t understand, and he would ask—curious, eager to learn. Those words often became the spark for hours of conversation.
He listened with genuine interest, never with judgment. She explained with joy, never with hesitation. In those exchanges, their bond grew stronger, a connection that felt as though it was never meant to be broken.
And as the days passed, one thought lingered quietly between them—who knows what might happen next…
Their bond was rare—something that didn’t happen every day, something that felt almost like a quiet miracle. It was beautiful in its simplicity, built not on grand gestures but on small moments of trust, laughter, and late-night words.
And most of all, it was theirs—untouched by the world outside, belonging only to the two of them, a secret space where they could be exactly who they were.

🍃 Little Moments, Big Memories
Life was moving smoothly, filled with little moments they shared—memes, reels, and stories that felt relatable to both of them.
That evening, she was having her dinner while he was buried in his project, too busy to eat. After finishing her meal, she began scrolling through Instagram, and a reel popped up: mountains, waterfalls, greenery—nature in its purest form, overflowing with peace. She thought of him instantly and sent it his way.
He was frustrated, his mind on the verge of exploding from the project’s chaos. Just as he was about to lose control, his phone pinged. He picked it up, and there she was again—with a new reel. In that moment, all his anger vanished like dust in the wind.
A bright smile spread across his face, and relief washed over him. It felt as though he had been waiting for this exact moment, for her message, to calm the storm inside him.
He watched the reel and confessed how much he longed to visit a place like that, to feel the peace of nature and escape the weight of stress. She teased him, saying she had already been there, already tasted that freedom—because she was never the stayer, always moving from one place to another.
He smiled knowingly and said, “I know, you’ve revolved around the world.” And just like that, his stress was gone.
That single reel became the spark for an endless conversation, one that carried them late into the night, weaving laughter, dreams, and comfort into their bond.

He slowly opened his eyes around 10 a.m., rubbing them as the chill of the morning lingered in the air. Still half-asleep, he stretched his arm to untangle the blanket wrapped around his legs, finally pulling it over himself for warmth. 
Just then, a rhythmic sound reached his ears. Curious, he pushed himself up and looked out the window. Nature was alive—birds singing soft melodies, leaves rustling gently, the world offering its best to the day.
He was exhausted, having worked on his project all night until 7 a.m. But this routine had become familiar—sleeping late, waking late, living in the rhythm of deadlines.
Remembering something, he headed to the kitchen, where his aunt was preparing lunch. “Can you make me a coffee, pleaseee?” he asked with a tired smile before slipping his phone open to check his messages. He sent a quick text, then told his aunt he’d freshen up while she made his coffee. She nodded warmly, amused by his pleading tone.
Meanwhile, miles away, she was getting ready for college. Pale and weary from a week of nonstop classes—her attendance short, her practical marks at stake—she forced herself through breakfast, grabbed her bag, and headed out.
At the metro station, waiting for the train, she pulled out her phone to distract herself. A notification lit up: “Is it raining there?” She smiled faintly and typed back: “No! Just a dry day.”
When he came out of the shower, he found his coffee mug waiting on his study table. He picked it up in one hand, his phone in the other, and took a sip. Closing his eyes, he savored the taste, then opened his phone with a small smile—tinged with disappointment that it wasn’t raining in her city. He texted back: “Oh no, ykw it’s raining here and it’s beautiful.”
Later that evening, she returned from college exhausted. She lay on her bed, staring at the ceiling, before freshening up. He was still busy with his project, checking his phone now and then, but finding no new notifications. 
Around 2 a.m., after finishing her assignment, she finally saw his message. She replied: “Was busy doing assignment. Did you enjoy the rain then? :)”
In the kitchen, her sister caught her off guard, scolding her for skipping dinner. She smiled hesitantly, then accepted the plate her sister handed her. Meanwhile, he heard the ping on his phone, dropped the pen he was holding, and replied instantly: “It’s okay! Yes, I enjoyed it—but not much.”
She read his message while holding a spoon, and quickly asked: “Why?”
He explained: “I mean, it was beautiful, but not that much. Yk I love rain. Do you?”
She smiled: “Of course I do. Who wouldn’t?”
He chuckled: “Yeah, who wouldn’t? You know, it feels amazing—walking down the street with someone we love in the rain. And when it stops, we buy roasted corn from a street vendor, eat together, and feel the cold air. It’s just amazing.”
She widened her eyes in amazement: “Wow.” Then she teased him: “With whom do you do this?”
He laughed softly: “I haven’t done it yet. But I want to. I really want to experience it :)”
She teased again: “Oohh, nice dream.”
And just like that, their conversation stretched on—dreams, laughter, and the kind of bond that made even ordinary rain feel extraordinary.
“Had dinner?” he asked.
“Yepp,” she replied.
“What was in it?”
“Non-veg,” she said teasingly.
He groaned, “You and your chicken!” and laughed a little.
“So what!” she shot back, grinning. “You should try it at least once in your life.” She tried to make him feel a little awkward with her words, but ended up laughing as soon as he did.
“What about you? What did you have?” she asked in return.
He listed off a few vegetables. She rolled her eyes, sent him the emoji, and teased, “You and your veggies.”
They both laughed, the conversation light and playful.

“So when are you planning to come to Delhi?” she asked.
“When will you want me to come over there?” he replied.
She smiled. “Whenever your budget allows, you can come here ::)).”
“I really want to,” he said without hesitation. “But right now I don’t have time. As soon as I complete my graduation, I’ll definitely come over to meet you.”
Her eyes lit up. “Woah, that would be fun! We’ll roam the streets of Delhi, and I’ll make sure you visit every tourist place—even the ones I haven’t been to yet.” She laughed at her own words, and he joined in.
“I really mean it,” he said, his tone steady. “I will come.”
She froze for a second, then softened. “Okay, okay, I get it. We’ll try a lot of food together and explore everything, okay?”
He smiled at her childish excitement. “Okay.”
Then, nervously, he asked, “So… when are you going to show me your face?” His heart raced, worried she might feel insecure or upset. She paused, staring at the screen, and he grew anxious as the typing dots danced up and down. His body shivered, his heartbeat quickened. Finally, her reply appeared: “The day you come to Delhi will be the day you see my face.”
Relief washed over him. She hadn’t made it awkward; she had answered calmly, protecting both their feelings. In that moment, he realized how mature she was for her age—knowing when to be funny, when to be smart, when to be kind, and when to hold back. He smiled and simply said, “Definitely,” letting the topic fade respectfully.
The conversation flowed on.
“What’s your favorite food, by the way?” she asked.
“Rajma,” he replied.
She laughed. “Is that even something we’d consider a favorite? Huh!”
He sent a disappointed-face emoji. “Of course. I’m a vegetarian.”
“Ohkay, sorry :)” she teased.
He asked her the same question. She told him about Yakhni. Curious, he Googled it, sent her a screenshot, and asked, “Does it look like this?”
She burst out laughing—it was adorable. “Why are you searching non-veg dishes?”
He hesitated, then said, “So I can order it for you when we meet.”
She teased, “What will you eat then?”
“Some veggies, I guess,” he replied.
They both laughed until their stomachs hurt.
“Even if you come here and have dinner with me, you’ll just eat grass—oh my God!” she joked.
“You have to try Yakhni at least once in your life,” she insisted.
He laughed. “No way!”
But she kept teasing, encouraging him to try it someday.
Finally, she asked with genuine curiosity, “If you come to Delhi for real and won’t eat non-veg, and I don’t like vegetables, what will we eat together?”
He thought for a moment, then smiled. “Ummm… maybe sweets. No veg side, no non-veg side. Just sweetness.”
Her lips curved into a wide smile. “Woah, that would be great.”
And in that moment, they both realized—they were each other’s mirror, reflecting back the best parts of themselves.

He came back from college and collapsed into bed, sleeping like a baby for nearly seven hours straight—from 4 p.m. until 11 p.m. Meanwhile, she spent the day focusing on herself. With her attendance now on track, she no longer needed to go to college every day; three days a week would be enough to keep things steady.
She pampered herself with skincare, made some snacks, shared them with her siblings, and simply enjoyed a normal, quiet day.
When he finally woke up from his long dream-filled nap, his siblings were staring at him with exaggerated expressions. They teased him: “Look who’s awake after a nonstop sleep! Aww, Sleeping Beauty—you must be tired after a hundred years of rest. Do you want us to serve you, sir?”
He glanced back and forth at them, then walked downstairs. In the kitchen, he opened the fridge, grabbed a bottle of water, and drank it in one gulp to shake off the drowsiness.
With a towel draped around his neck, he headed back to his room, whistling softly. He pulled out his phone, checked his inbox, and suddenly it froze. He shook it in frustration until it finally started working again, sighing with relief.
By then, it was almost midnight, and his siblings were still awake—his sister scrolling on her phone, his younger brother bent over his homework.
He opened his inbox again and saw reels she had sent. He watched them, reacted, and checked if she had seen the ones he’d shared. She had—her reactions made him smile. He typed a message.
She was lying on her bed when his text popped up:
Him: “Are you up?”
Her: “Of course.”
Him: “How was the day?”
Her: “As usual, boring.”
Him: “Dinner?”
Her: “Done! You?”
Him: “I just woke up. Slept the whole time.”
Her: “Are you feeling good?”
Him: “Yes, nothing to worry about.”
Her: “Good to hear.”
They exchanged details about their day.
Her: “Agh, I’m so tired.”
Him: “Then get some rest.”
Her: “Yeah, I will. What are your siblings doing?”
Him: “My sister just went to bed, and my brother is still doing homework.”
Her: “Okay.”
Suddenly, his phone froze again.
Her: “??”
Him: “What?”
Her: “You were typing something…”
Him: “No, I wasn’t.”
Her: “Yes, you were—it showed typing… typing…”
Him: “Oh, that must be a glitch. My phone keeps hanging. I thought you were typing too—it showed me the same.”
They both laughed at their stupidity 

The night was quiet, the kind of silence that carried only the soft hum of ceiling fans and the occasional shuffle of papers from his brother’s desk. He leaned back against his bed, phone in hand, and typed with a grin.
“Y’know, my phone is so old. During the pandemic, me and my siblings pooled our pocket money to buy it. I’m still using the same one, hahaha.”
Her reply came almost instantly, as if she had been waiting for his words.
“Ohhh, same goes for me! My father bought this phone for me and my younger sister during lockdown. And guess what? I’m still using it too.”
They both laughed at the coincidence, imagining how their phones had survived years of drops, scratches, and endless scrolling. It wasn’t just about the devices—it was about the memories tied to them. Those phones had carried their boredom, their late-night chats, their secrets, and their laughter through the strangest of times.
He paused for a moment, then typed again, his tone softer, more thoughtful.
“I’m thinking of gifting a phone to my brother on his birthday. He’s been asking me for so long.”
Her heart warmed at the message.
“Oh, that’s such a great idea. He’ll be so happy.”
She could almost picture his younger brother’s face lighting up, the way siblings do when they receive something they’ve been wishing for. That was who he was—thoughtful, generous, loving. Even in the smallest gestures, he carried a kind of quiet kindness that made her smile at her screen.
For a moment, neither of them typed. They just sat there, each in their own room, miles apart, yet connected by the glow of their old phones. The pandemic had given them these devices, but it was their bond that kept them alive with meaning.

He hesitated before typing, his fingers hovering over the screen.
“But I’m kind of worried about giving him a phone at such a young age.”
She replied quickly, curious. “Why?”
He sighed, staring at the blinking cursor. “I’m not sure… just worried about how he’ll use it.”
Her response came with a reassuring tone, almost like a gentle smile through the words.
“Oh, don’t worry. He’s your brother, and I’m sure he must be as mature as you. He’ll use the gift wisely.”
Her confidence in him—and in his brother—made him pause. It wasn’t just about the phone anymore. It was about trust, responsibility, and the bond they both shared with their siblings. He realized that sometimes, gifts weren’t just objects; they were symbols of love, faith, and belief in someone’s growth.
