The Friend Who Stayed Up With Me 

It all began with a reel. 

She was scrolling through Instagram when a video popped up: “Drop your birthday and find someone born on the same day.” It was playful, random, and oddly inviting. She scrolled through the comments and saw: “Mine: 12th Jan.” 

She replied, “Mine too.” 

He responded, “Nice.” 

She asked, “Which year?” 

He said, “2004. Yours?” 

She replied, “2005.” 

That tiny exchange, buried in a comment section, was the beginning of something rare. For two days, they chatted under that reel, exchanging bits of curiosity and warmth. Then he asked, “Would you like to talk in inbox?” She said yes. 

She messaged first: “Heyya.” He replied instantly. They exchanged names. And just like that, the conversation began. 

🌆 Two Cities, One Connection 

He lived in Maharashtra, in a joint family full of cousins, aunts, and uncles. His parents were away for work, and his home was always buzzing with noise, responsibilities, and interruptions. She was in Delhi, having moved there recently for her graduation. It wasn’t her birthplace, but it was her present. 

He was in his third year of engineering. She was just starting college. Their lives were different, their cities far apart, their religions not the same—but none of that mattered. They clicked. Instantly. Effortlessly. 

They became each other’s best buddy. 

🌙 The Rhythm of Friendship 

Every day after college, they’d talk. They’d share everything—the lectures, the boredom, the moments of loneliness. Some days, they didn’t feel like socializing at all. Like many others, they’d skip college now and then, stay in bed, and just talk to each other. It was enough. 

He became her night companion. She had insomnia, and the nights felt endless. But he was always there. If she messaged at midnight, he replied within minutes. Not out of obligation,—but because he wanted to. Because he cared. He was her quiet anchor. And she was his listener, his encourager, his safe space. 

They talked about their families. He told her about his younger siblings, the cousins who teased him, the chaos of his joint household. She listened, really listened. And he opened up in ways he didn’t with anyone else. 

🕌 A Bond Beyond Boundaries 

He was an introvert. Making friends wasn’t easy for him. Most of his school friends had moved away, and the few he still spoke to were birthday-text friends—occasional, distant. But with her, he was different. He talked. He laughed. He shared. 

They came from different religions, but their friendship was untouched by boundaries. She’d use words from her culture that he didn’t understand, and he’d ask, curious. Those words became topics for hours of conversation. He listened with interest, not judgment. She explained with joy, not hesitation. 

Their bond was rare. It was beautiful. And it was theirs. 

🍃 Little Moments, Big Memories 

One night, she sent him a reel of mountains, waterfalls, and greenery. He opened up, saying he longed to visit a peaceful place like that. She teased him, saying she’d already been there. He smiled. That reel became the reason for an endless conversation. 

Another time, it was raining in his city. He asked if it was raining in hers. It wasn’t. He described his dream: walking in the rain with someone, stopping for roasted corn from a street vendor, feeling the cold air, sharing that moment. She teased him, “Who do you want to do that with?” He chuckled, “I haven’t done it yet. But I want to.” She said, “Oohh nice dream.” And they talked for hours. 

They shared dinner updates. She’d say, “I had non-veg,” just to make him laugh. He’d groan, “You and your chicken!” But he always smiled. 

He’d often share that his siblings were still awake late at night, doing homework, playing, using the phone. They all shared one room. And yet, he always made time for her. 

During the pandemic, he told her how he and his siblings pooled their pocket money to buy a phone. She shared that her father had bought one for her and her sisters too. They laughed—they were both still using those same phones. 

He once mentioned he was gifting a phone to his younger brother for his birthday. That’s who he was—thoughtful, generous, loving. 

They dreamed of meeting in person. She’d tease him: “Come to Delhi. We’ll roam the streets, eat everything, make memories, and feel every moment.” He said jokingly, “I’ll definitely come. One day.” 

She joked, “The day we meet will be the day we finally see each other’s face—the one we’ve been yearning for.” 

It was a dream they both held onto, quietly, hopefully. 

One night, they talked about favorite foods. She told him about Yakhni. Even though he was vegetarian, he was curious. He Googled it, sent her a screenshot, and asked, “Does it look like this?” She laughed—it was adorable. She teased him, “Why are you searching non-veg dishes?” He hesitated, then said, “So I can order it for you when we meet.” She asked, “What will you eat?” He replied, “Some veggies, I guess.” They both burst out laughing. 

She told him, “You have to try Yakhni at least once in your life.” He laughed and said, “No way!” But she teased him, encouraged him to try it someday. 

She joked, “If you come to Delhi for real and won’t eat non-veg, and I don’t like vegetables, what will we eat together?” 

He replied, “Ummmm... maybe, Sweets. No veg side, no non-veg side. Just sweetness.” He smiled. 

They were each other’s mirror, reflecting back the best parts of themselves. 

📵 The Block, the Exams, and the Birthday 

During her exams, she felt distracted. Without warning, she blocked him. No explanation. Just silence. Later, she told a friend, who said, “You shouldn’t have done that. He’ll think he did something wrong.” 

She unblocked him and explained everything. He hadn’t even noticed—he’d been asleep. It was 3 PM. He hadn’t slept all night. He laughed when she apologized. “You don’t have to be sorry. You did it for a reason, he said. She told him about her exams. He said, “Then don’t open the app if it’s distracting you.” 

She told him he was one of only two friends she had. He understood. He asked, “When will you unblock me?” She didn’t know. She said, “After exams.” 

Their birthday was coming. She missed him terribly. She didn’t message him, but she wished him in her heart. 

💔 The Last Message 

Six months passed. 

She finally unblocked him. It was early morning—around 6 AM. His last active status was 2 hours ago. She guessed he’d just gone to sleep. She waited. The status changed: 3 hours ago. 4. 5. 6. 

She waited. 

Finally, he replied with a simple greeting. 

She asked, “Were you ignoring me?” 

He said, “No. Why would I? I had no reason to.” 

They talked. They caught up. He wished her a happy birthday and apologized for the late greeting — and she did the same. She told him she had wished him on his birthday, silently, from the heart. He smiled and said, “I did too. I had no other choice… you had blocked me.” 

They laughed. It felt like no time had passed, even though it had been half a year. 

Then came the moment she never wanted to face. 

She asked him to stop messaging her. 

He asked why. 

She explained. 

He pleaded, “We don’t have to talk daily. Just once in a while. Just to check in. Please?” 

With a heavy heart, she said no. 

She asked him to promise. 

He did. No anger, no fight—just a quiet ending. 

Tears streamed down her cheeks. She didn’t know if he cried too. But she hoped he felt the same ache. The same loss. 

🌠 Still Wondering 

Now, it’s been more than a year and a half. She’s working. She’s grown. But the ache remains, and the silence he left behind still hums quietly in her chest. She wants to tell him everything—how life has been, how the world feels cruel sometimes, how she misses him in ways she can’t put into words. She wonders how he’s doing. Is he still awake at night? 

She feels guilty. He once told her he didn’t have many friends. That he rarely opened up. And she was the one he trusted. The one he laughed with. The one he stayed up for. 

She left him alone. 

And that guilt lingers. 

It wasn’t love. It was something quieter, maybe rarer. Respect. Trust. A friendship that asked for nothing but gave everything. 

She doesn’t know if he misses her. She doesn’t know if he ever will. But she remembers. 

She still remembers everything—every word, every laugh, every reel, every rainy day dream. She wonders if he remembers too. If he ever thinks of her. If he got the job he wanted. If he’s okay. 

She doesn’t know. 

But she hopes. 

And she carries the memory of a friendship that asked for nothing but gave everything. 

The ending never really ended. 

It’s still stuck in both their hearts.
